Haemoprotozoan_Classification

Some things to note: 
1. I was trying out 4 class classification (3 x haemoprotozoan + uninfected), but that is not yielding a high enough accuracy 
It's also a pain to test out parameters etc, can't do it in time 

2. I rotated the infected/non-infected images and mirrored them to increase the dataset size 

3. currently, 0 - not infected, 1 - infected (based on certainty)
0.5 is the inflection point where we decide the result
